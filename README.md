# Protein-Data-Analysis
Using various observed metrics such as amino acid residues, the program will try to predict factors of certian proteins and eventually protein sequences

# Getting Started
Clone the repo and extract the deatabase zip folder. Then open up the file LoadData.py and change the train model fucntion. To test with weights that have already been trained, load in the weights desired from the 'Weights' folder. If new weights need to be set, input the NN shape in the function shape parameter and run the file.

# Prerequisites

```
Tensorflow (GPU version of tensorflow recomended due to the larger and models. If only using previous weights to predict CPU based tensorflow is acceptable)
```
